# Burger View Controller
Burger View Controller is a burger restaurant app based off of the Model View Controller. Customers can input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Demonstration:

## Installation: 
- Run `npm install`
- Run `dotevn`
- Run `mysql`
- Run `inquirer`
- Run `express-handlebars`

## Description:

Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, an ORM - you can create a burger, add it to the menu, and devour it. The name buger-view-controller is because I follow the MVC design pattern.

## Create a MVC file structure: 

- 1: Config (connection.js and orm.js)
- 2: Controllers (burger_controller.js)
- 3: db (schema.sql and seeds.sql)
- 4: models (burgers.js)
- 5: node_modules
- 6: Package.json
- 7: public [assets(css and img)]
- 8: server.js
- 9: views (handlerbars)

Once the files are set up, we need to create the connection among them.
